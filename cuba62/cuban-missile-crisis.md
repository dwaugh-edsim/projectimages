## TARGET 1: THE DISCOVERY (October 14-15, 1962)
### U-2 Photographic Intelligence Readout — San Cristobal MRBM Sites

On the morning of October 14, 1962, Major Richard Heyser began a reconnaissance flight over Cuba at 70,000 feet. He flew almost due north—on a course approximately 60 miles west of Havana—crossing the northern beaches six minutes later. In that brief span, he captured 928 photographs on high-resolution film, covering a swath 75 miles wide, with resolution of roughly three feet.

At McCoy Air Force Base near Orlando, Florida, the exposed film was rushed into special shipping containers, loaded onto a courier aircraft, and flown at once to the Naval Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) at Suitland, Maryland. Late in the day the film arrived; through the night the Center developed the original negatives and began producing duplicate positives on clear acetate for detailed analysis.

The first duplicates reached NPIC just before 10:00 AM on October 15. By 1600 hours, photointerpreters were almost certain they had identified large surface-to-surface missiles. Within another hour, they were confident enough that Arthur Lundahl, Director of NPIC, informed CIA Headquarters that offensive missile sites had been discovered in Cuba.

The key identifications included:  
- **San Cristobal (MR-1):** Medium-range ballistic missile deployment southwest of Havana, with canvas-covered trailers consistent with SS-4 MRBMs (approximately 1,100 nautical mile range), associated erector-launchers, support equipment, and logistical infrastructure.  
- **Sagua la Grande:** Additional MRBM site of similar configuration and readiness.  
- **Guanajay (IR-1):** An intermediate-range ballistic missile site (2,000+ nautical mile range), confirmed with high confidence by October 18.

The readout assessed with high confidence that nuclear warheads were present or arriving, based on distinctive storage patterns at key sites, and that MRBMs in Cuba could significantly augment Soviet first-strike capability within weeks. When Arthur Lundahl briefed President Kennedy on the morning of October 16, and Kennedy asked how certain he was that these were offensive missile sites, Lundahl replied that he was as sure “as a photographic interpreter can be sure of anything.”

This intelligence was decisive: it confirmed that the Soviet deployment in Cuba constituted an offensive nuclear capability, not merely defensive weaponry, and set in motion the 13 days of crisis that followed.

## TARGET 2: THE DEBATE (October 18-19, 1962)
### Joint Chiefs Memo (Advocating Air Strike) vs. RFK Notes (Advocating Blockade)

**Document Reference:** Joint Chiefs of Staff memorandum; ExComm meeting minutes; Robert F. Kennedy’s private notes  
**Primary Archives:** Naval War College; John F. Kennedy Presidential Library; National Security Archive

On October 17, 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted a memorandum to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara advocating a decisive military response. The Chiefs recommended large-scale air strikes against all known missile sites, airfields, nuclear weapon storage facilities, and other major military targets in Cuba, followed by an invasion under existing contingency plans (notably OPLAN 314). From their perspective, anything short of overwhelming force would leave the United States vulnerable once the missiles became operational.

At the October 19 Cabinet Room meeting, the Chiefs, led by General Curtis LeMay, presented their case directly to President Kennedy. LeMay, invoking the failure of appeasement in the 1930s, characterized a blockade as dangerously weak, saying it would be “almost as bad as appeasement at Munich” and that it would be a “pure disaster” to rely on such a measure. He pressed for a prompt air strike, arguing that the earliest feasible date was October 21, with October 23 the optimal time before the missiles could become fully operational.

McNamara’s view evolved over the week. Initially open to a surgical air strike, he became increasingly concerned about the risks of escalation. He warned that even a carefully targeted attack could kill hundreds or thousands of Soviet and Cuban personnel and that Moscow would be compelled to retaliate, likely in Berlin or against allied targets elsewhere. Robert Kennedy, reflecting on the moral and political implications, emphasized in ExComm discussions that an unannounced strike would resemble Pearl Harbor and that mass casualties in Cuba would make it “almost incumbent upon the Russians” to reintroduce missiles or respond forcefully elsewhere.

In his private notes and later recollections, RFK framed the choice as one between a path that almost certainly risked general war and another that preserved room for negotiation. Together, McNamara and RFK pushed for a naval “quarantine” as a first step, with air strike options held in reserve. Kennedy ultimately sided with them, instructing the Chiefs to refine both air strike and blockade plans but selecting the quarantine as the initial course.

This decision reflected a deliberate weighing of military necessity against the risk of World War III. The Chiefs’ preferred option promised rapid military success but carried enormous escalation risks, especially given unknowns about Soviet forces on the ground. The blockade, by contrast, was militarily less decisive but strategically safer, preserving time for diplomacy and reducing the likelihood of immediate nuclear confrontation.

## TARGET 3: THE LEGAL BASIS (October 22-23, 1962)
### Draft of JFK’s “Quarantine” Speech + OAS Resolution

**Primary Documents:**  
- President Kennedy’s Radio and Television Report to the American People on the Soviet Arms Buildup in Cuba (October 22, 1962)  
- Presidential Proclamation 3504 (Interdiction of the Delivery of Offensive Weapons to Cuba)  
- Resolution of the Organ of Consultation of the Organization of American States (October 23, 1962)

In his October 22 address, Kennedy laid out the legal and moral justification for what he termed a “strict quarantine” rather than a blockade. He began by presenting the photographic evidence, stating that unmistakable proof showed offensive missile sites in Cuba designed “to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere.” He framed the Soviet deployment as a deliberate deception and as a threat so grave that any substantial increase in nuclear strike capability must be treated as a direct challenge to peace.

Kennedy then announced a series of steps, the first of which was the quarantine: a naval interdiction of all offensive military equipment bound for Cuba. He explicitly distinguished this from a full blockade by noting that the United States was not denying “the necessities of life” to the Cuban people, unlike the Soviet blockade of Berlin. He also announced the convening of the OAS Organ of Consultation to invoke the Rio Treaty and an appeal to the United Nations Security Council for the removal of the missiles under international supervision.

Proclamation 3504, signed on October 23, provided the domestic and hemispheric legal framework. Citing the Constitution, a recent joint resolution of Congress, the Rio Treaty, and the OAS resolution, it authorized U.S. naval and air forces to intercept and inspect vessels bound for Cuba and to turn back those carrying offensive weapons. It carefully defined “offensive weapons” to include surface-to-surface missiles, bombers, associated warheads, and supporting equipment, and limited enforcement to these categories. Force was explicitly to be used only if vessels refused to comply.

The OAS resolution, adopted with strong support from hemispheric allies, recommended that member states take all necessary measures, including the use of armed force, to prevent the introduction or activation of offensive missiles in Cuba. This collective authorization under the Rio Treaty gave the quarantine legal cover as a regional security measure rather than a unilateral U.S. act of war.

Taken together, the speech, proclamation, and OAS resolution constructed a legal and diplomatic foundation for the quarantine that sought to avoid the formal designation of a blockade, which in international law is generally considered an act of war. The administration thus balanced firmness in confronting the deployment with a legal posture designed to preserve international legitimacy and reduce the risk of uncontrolled escalation.

## TARGET 4: THE SHOWDOWN (October 24, 1962)
### Naval Intelligence Cable on Soviet Ships Gagarin and Komiles Turning Back

**Document Reference:** U.S. Navy and CIA morning intelligence summaries; oral briefings to the ExComm  
**Primary Archives:** Naval War College studies; JFK Library crisis chronologies

When the quarantine formally went into effect on the morning of October 24, attention turned to a group of Soviet merchant ships and tankers en route to Cuba. U.S. intelligence tracked these vessels through a combination of radio direction finding, signals intercepts, and maritime surveillance. Among the ships drawing particular interest were the tankers and freighters suspected of carrying missile-related cargoes, including vessels identified in U.S. reporting as the Gagarin and the Komiles, as well as the Poltava and others.

Early that morning, U.S. Navy and CIA analysts reported to the ExComm that several Soviet ships had slowed or stopped short of the quarantine line. Direction finding suggested that at least some of them were altering course. One tanker, the Bucharest, known to be carrying oil rather than military cargo, was allowed to continue toward Cuba as a calculated signal that the United States would enforce only an offensive-weapons quarantine, not a total embargo.

By late morning Washington time, updated reports indicated that the key freighters believed to be carrying offensive military equipment had in fact reversed course or had ceased closing on the quarantine line. Radio intercepts from Soviet merchant captains to their superiors referenced changes in routing due to “the political situation,” reinforcing the assessment that new orders had come from Moscow. No Soviet ship attempted to force a direct confrontation with U.S. naval forces at the line.

When Admiral George Anderson, Chief of Naval Operations, briefed President Kennedy, he reported that while precise locations were always subject to the limitations of radio direction-finding, “all signs point to a course change” and that there had been no challenges to U.S. ships enforcing the quarantine. This information allowed Kennedy to maintain the quarantine without immediately escalating to the use of force. It also provided the empirical basis for later comments by Secretary of State Dean Rusk that the two sides had been “eyeball to eyeball” and that it appeared “the other fellow just blinked.”

The naval intelligence picture on October 24 therefore served as the first concrete indication that Khrushchev was prepared to avoid a direct clash at sea and to explore a negotiated resolution. It validated the choice of quarantine over air strike by demonstrating that the mere threat of interdiction, backed by credible force, could alter Soviet behavior without the immediate use of violence.

## TARGET 5: THE ESCALATION (October 27, 1962)
### U-2 Downing Report (Major Rudolf Anderson) + Khrushchev’s “Soft” Letter

**Document Reference:** ExComm recordings and notes; Defense and CIA incident reports; Khrushchev’s October 26 letter to Kennedy  
**Primary Archives:** JFK Library; National Security Archive; Russian archival publications

On October 27, often called “Black Saturday,” the crisis reached its most dangerous point. That morning, Major Rudolf Anderson Jr., a U-2 pilot assigned to high-altitude reconnaissance over Cuba, was conducting a mission over eastern Cuba when his aircraft was engaged by a Soviet SA-2 surface-to-air missile battery near Banes. Three missiles were fired; one detonated close enough to send shrapnel through the aircraft and Anderson’s pressure suit, causing fatal decompression. The U-2 crashed; Anderson was killed.

News of the shootdown reached Washington within hours. In an ExComm meeting that afternoon, Secretary McNamara informed President Kennedy that a U-2 had been shot down over Cuba and that the pilot was presumed dead. The Joint Chiefs and senior Defense officials pressed for an immediate retaliatory strike against the offending SAM sites, arguing that failure to respond would appear weak and invite further Soviet aggression. General Taylor and others recommended air strikes on the Banes site and other SAM locations.

Kennedy, however, chose not to authorize immediate retaliation. He questioned who had ordered the firing—Moscow or local commanders in Cuba—and insisted on seeing how Khrushchev would respond to ongoing diplomatic exchanges before taking any irreversibly escalatory action. This restraint, exercised under intense pressure and after an American combat death, was a pivotal decision in preventing the crisis from spiraling into open war.

Complicating the situation, the shootdown occurred against the backdrop of Nikita Khrushchev’s first major private letter to Kennedy, received on October 26. In that “soft” letter, Khrushchev adopted a personal and emotional tone, framing the crisis as a shared dilemma between two leaders responsible for their peoples’ survival. He pointed out that the United States rightly sought security from missiles 90 miles away in Cuba, while the Soviet Union faced similar concerns from American missiles stationed in Turkey and other NATO countries on its borders.

Khrushchev proposed that the Soviet Union would remove “the means which you regard as offensive” from Cuba under appropriate guarantees, and that in return the United States should remove its analogous weapons from Turkey. Although this linkage would be made more explicit in a second, more formal “hard” letter on October 27, the soft letter already set out the basic contours of a potential trade.

Kennedy and his advisers recognized the soft letter as a signal that Khrushchev was searching for a way out. The President’s refusal to retaliate for Anderson’s death, combined with careful parsing of Khrushchev’s messages, kept open the possibility of a negotiated settlement even at the moment when the military logic for escalation seemed strongest.

## TARGET 6: THE RESOLUTION (October 27-28, 1962)
### RFK/Dobrynin Meeting Memo (Turkey/Jupiter Missile Trade)

**Document Reference:** Robert F. Kennedy’s contemporaneous notes; Anatoly Dobrynin’s cable to Moscow; Khrushchev’s October 27 letter  
**Primary Archives:** Russian Foreign Ministry archives; JFK Library; later declassified U.S. sources

On the night of October 27, President Kennedy sent his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, to meet secretly with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin at the Soviet Embassy in Washington. This back-channel meeting was designed to convey both the urgency of the situation and a potential formula for resolving it. No official transcript was made; our knowledge comes from RFK’s notes, Dobrynin’s cable to Moscow, and later recollections.

Robert Kennedy told Dobrynin that the United States was on the brink of military action. He emphasized that within a very short time—on the order of a day—U.S. forces would be ordered to attack missile sites and other strategic targets in Cuba if the Soviet missiles were not withdrawn. This was not a bluff; American forces had been moved to high alert, and invasion plans were in an advanced state of readiness. RFK wanted the Kremlin to understand that war, including the risk of nuclear war, was imminent unless a settlement was reached.

At the same time, RFK addressed the issue raised in Khrushchev’s letters regarding U.S. Jupiter missiles in Turkey. He indicated that the administration was prepared, within a few months, to remove those missiles as part of a broader modernization of NATO’s nuclear posture, but that this could not be part of any public agreement. Any public acknowledgment that the United States was trading Turkish missiles for Cuban missiles under Soviet pressure would be politically untenable, especially with NATO allies and domestic critics. The understanding on Turkey, therefore, had to remain secret.

Dobrynin’s cable to Moscow reported both elements: the seriousness of the U.S. threat to use force imminently and the confidential assurance that the Jupiter missiles in Turkey would be removed within a matter of months, provided that this aspect remained undisclosed. This cable was received and discussed by the Soviet leadership during critical deliberations in Moscow.

On October 28, Khrushchev announced publicly that the Soviet Union would dismantle and withdraw its missiles from Cuba under United Nations verification and had received assurances that the United States would not invade Cuba. The Turkish element of the deal remained hidden from public view. Over the following months, the United States quietly removed the Jupiter missiles from Turkey and Italy, completing the secret side of the bargain.

For years, the Turkish component of the compromise was denied or omitted from official accounts. Robert Kennedy’s published memoir, *Thirteen Days*, did not mention it, and senior Kennedy aide Theodore Sorensen later acknowledged editing out RFK’s references to the trade when the book was prepared. Only after the end of the Cold War, when Soviet-era archives were opened and Dobrynin’s cables became accessible, did historians fully confirm the nature of the quid pro quo.

The RFK–Dobrynin meeting and the resulting secret understanding on the Jupiter missiles were central to the resolution of the crisis. They provided Khrushchev with a face-saving way to justify withdrawal to his colleagues, while allowing Kennedy to claim publicly that the Soviet Union had backed down in the face of firm U.S. resolve. In substantive terms, the United States traded obsolete, vulnerable missiles in Turkey for the removal of far more provocative missiles in Cuba and a lasting non-invasion pledge—an exchange that, however controversial, helped avert nuclear war.

## Summary

Across these six targets, the documentary record shows how the Cuban Missile Crisis evolved from sudden discovery of offensive missiles, through intense civil–military debate and creative legal framing, to a naval confrontation and a deadly escalation, and finally to a secret bargain that both sides judged preferable to the risks of war. Each stage reflects a different facet of crisis management: intelligence interpretation, strategic choice, legal justification, operational control, emotional restraint after loss of life, and clandestine diplomacy. Together, they form a coherent timeline that can be used to build high-fidelity historical simulations and teaching assets.
